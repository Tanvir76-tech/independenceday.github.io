        <h1>History of Independence of India</h1>
        <blockquote>
            The rule of the Mughals, which began in 1526
         with Babur's accession to the throne, ended 
         with the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. After
         the fall of the Mughal Empire, the Marathas,
         Jats,Rajputs and Ruhellas emerged as regional
         powers.Awadh,Bengal,Deccan and Mysore became
         independent states.The country was divided
         politically, and there was no sense of national
         unity.This political vaccum provided an opportunity
         for the British to gain ground.In India,Britain was
         represented by the British East India company,
         which started off as a joint stock company. It
         had been given a royal charter in 1600 to pursue trade
         in the East Indies(land of south and southeast Asia).By 
         the 1750s East India Company began interfering in India
         affairs.

         <blockquote>
            It is claimed that the British rule in India actually 
            began after the British defeated Siraj-Ud-Daulah,the Nawab of 
            Bengal, in the Battle of Plassey on June 23,1757. Robert Clive of the 
            EIC defeated the forces of Siraj-Ud-Daulah and his French support 
            troops.Clive thought that the best way to safeguard the Company's 
            interests in Bengal was to replace Siraj with a new and more 
            subservient nawab.He found a candidate in a disgruntled general
            named Mir Jafar. Siraj-Ud-Daulah was killed by his own people,with 
            Mir Jafar replacing him. After the Battle of Plassey and Battle of Buxar
            the British became the masters of Bengal.

         <blockquote>
            At 1857 the Indians started the first war of independence but they lost as the whole India was not 
            united.Some of the famous freedom fighter of the war were Tantia Tope, Nanasahib, Rani Lakshmi
            Bai.In 1885 A.O Hume formed it. Its first President was Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee.In 1905 British government,Lord
            Curzon, Viceroy in India announced that Bengal will be divided in two parts one for hindus and the other part for the muslims.
            The partition came into effect in 1905.At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, 
            Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.
            Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people 
            primarily by Gokhale.

         <blockquote>
            Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, 
            and his insistence on working inside the system .On April 13,1919,Baisakhi
            celebrations were being held in Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar. Without any warning
            general Dyer attacked on the unarmed people it resulted to death of several 1000 peoples. Batukeshwar Dutt exploded two bombs, along with Bhagat Singh, in the Central
            Legislative Assembly in New Delhi on 8 April 1929.The Salt Satyagraha was a mass civil disobedience
            movement initiated by Mahatma Gandhi against the salt tax imposed by the British government in India. He led a large group of 
            people from Sabarmati Ashram on 12<sup>th</sup> March 1930 till Dandi, a coastal village in Gujarat, to break the salt law by producing salt from seawater.

            In 1943 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose created Azad Hind Fouz which was 
            supported by Japan, Nazi Germany, the Italian Social Republic and their allies.
            Under his provisional government, the Indians became united and participated in World War 2.
            The Quit India movement by Gandhiji called for immediate independence of India
            and finally at midnight of 15<sup>th</sup> August 1947 India became free from 
            British and Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru became the first prime minister of free India.
